1.1 Overall strategy
We will perform Unit Testing on all of our functions or components, to check for its validity also checking for any exceptions . Marc will perform Unit Testing.

1.2 Test Selection
We will use on unit testing and we will make sure to check for any loop holes that might leads to irregular behaviour. We must have a limit on the scope of the function's ability.

1.3 Adequacy Criterion
For unit testing we need to evaluate results such that each individual units or components derives the intended results. This will help us detect bugs at early stage.

1.4 Bug Tracking
With unit testing our results will evaluate the code for bugs and track why these bugs are causing issues and we can take actions on it in difference phases

1.5 Technology
We will use JUnit Testing for this system
